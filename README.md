# F-divergence

This is a very rough reimplementation for *[A framework for robustness certification of smoothed classifiers using f-divergence ](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SJlKrkSFPH)* (Dvijotham etc, 2020 ICLR).

We build the framework for 2-norm bound and guassian noise, using two hockey-stick divergences as the constraints. And the experiment is only performed on cifar-10. 

Later, we may release more detailed analysis and experiment results...
